## 9. Conclusion

The SDKWork Music project has been successfully restructured to align with sdkwork-specs standards. The new architecture provides:

- **Clear Separation:** Each application surface has its own root with proper boundaries
- **Standard Compliance:** All surfaces follow SDKWork architecture standards
- **SDK Consistency:** Shared API contracts and SDK families across all surfaces
- **Maintainability:** Clear directory structure and documentation
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new application surfaces or packages

The project is now ready for feature implementation across all three platforms (PC, H5, Flutter mobile) while maintaining architectural consistency and SDKWork standards compliance.
